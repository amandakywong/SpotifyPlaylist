# SpotifyPlaylist

This JavaScript script allows you to save your Spotify Discover Weekly playlist into a new playlist called "Saved Weekly." The script interacts with the Spotify API, enabling you to manually pull the songs from your Discover Weekly playlist and store them in a separate playlist for future reference.

Please note that this script is currently not automated, meaning you need to run it manually each week to save the songs from your updated Discover Weekly playlist.

Prerequisites

* Node.js installed on your machine.
* A Spotify account and access to the Spotify Developer Dashboard.
